### Election-Audit Summary
This script employs an if-then statement nested in a for loop, which is designed to loop through each line of data and tabulate values based on the parameters set by the analyist. It can be reused with minor changes to audit or tabulate any election, as well as gather the informtion needed from a .csv file in order to provide an analysis. In this case, we have tablulated both the winning candidate (and her willing vote total and percentage), and the county with the largest voter turnout (and its total vote count and percentage of total votes). This analysis clearly illustrates that the candidate who wins Denver is likely to win the election as a whole, as Ms. Degette did. I would recommend focusing future marketing and campaign efforts on that county.
